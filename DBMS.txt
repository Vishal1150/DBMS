Q1.
-> A database is a structured collection of organized data that allows for efficient storage, retrieval, and management.

-> It provides a reliable and centralized repository for information, enhancing data organization, retrieval speed, data integrity,     security, and scalability. 

-> For example, in a company database, employee details like names, departments, and salaries can be efficiently stored and retrieved.


Q2.

-> A file-based storage system organizes data into files and lacks inherent relationships between them. 
-> Challenges include data redundancy, inconsistency, isolation, limited query capabilities, security concerns, and scalability issues.


Q3. 

-> DBMS stands for Database Management System. It is software that facilitates the creation, organization, and management of databases. -> The need for DBMS arises to centralize data, ensure data integrity, provide efficient retrieval, and enable secure and controlled access to data.


Q4.

-> Data Redundancy:

Challenge: File-based systems often led to redundant data stored in multiple files, consuming extra storage space.

DBMS Solution: Centralized data storage and relational databases minimize redundancy through normalization, reducing data duplication.


-> Data Inconsistency:

Challenge: Changes in one file might not be reflected in others, causing data inconsistencies.

DBMS Solution: DBMS enforces integrity constraints, ensuring changes made to data are consistent across the entire database.

-> Limited Data Relationships:

Challenge: File-based systems struggled to establish relationships between different sets of data.

DBMS Solution: DBMS provides a relational model, allowing for the creation of relationships between tables, facilitating a more connected and structured view of data.

-> Data Isolation:

Challenge: Files were often isolated, making it challenging to share data between different applications.

DBMS Solution: DBMS supports concurrent access and data sharing among multiple users and applications while maintaining data integrity and consistency.


-> Limited Query Capabilities:

Challenge: File-based systems had limited query capabilities, making it difficult to retrieve specific information.

DBMS Solution: DBMS provides a query language (e.g., SQL) and query optimization, allowing users to efficiently retrieve, filter, and manipulate data, enhancing the system's querying capabilities.




Q5. 

Time-Series Database Management System:

Explanation: Specialized for handling time-series data, such as sensor data, stock prices, or IoT data. Optimized for chronological queries.

Graph Database Management System:

Explanation: Focuses on relationships between entities, using graph structures. Suitable for applications involving complex network relationships.


Document-Oriented Database Management System:

Explanation: Stores and retrieves semi-structured data in document formats (e.g., JSON, XML). MongoDB is a popular example.

Distributed Database Management System:

Explanation: Spreads data across multiple servers or locations, enhancing scalability and fault tolerance. Examples include Amazon Aurora and Google Spanner.

NoSQL Database Management System:

Explanation: Suitable for unstructured or semi-structured data. NoSQL databases, like MongoDB and Cassandra, provide flexibility and scalability for large datasets.
